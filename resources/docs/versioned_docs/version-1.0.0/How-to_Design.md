## Example 1

### Condition

We have a form with the list of orders, where each order is associated with a list of books and its posted payments.

import {CodeSample} from './CodeSample.mdx'

<CodeSample url="https://documentation.lsfusion.org/sample?file=UseCaseDesign&block=sample1"/>

We need to customize the design of the form, so that the lines and payments can be displayed on dedicated tabs which are separated from the list of orders using a vertical splitter.

### Solution

<CodeSample url="https://documentation.lsfusion.org/sample?file=UseCaseDesign&block=solution1"/>

The form will look like this:

## Example 2

### Condition

Similar to Example 1, except we have added filters by date and customer to the form.

<CodeSample url="https://documentation.lsfusion.org/sample?file=UseCaseDesign&block=sample2"/>

We need to add filtering elements to the design of the previously created form.

### Solution

<CodeSample url="https://documentation.lsfusion.org/sample?file=UseCaseDesign&block=solution2"/>

Result:
