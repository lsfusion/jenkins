To create an [action](Actions.md) that performs a sequence of other actions, the [**{...}** operator](Operator_..._.md) is used - a block enclosed by curly brackets. The body of this block must contain a sequence of [action operators](Оperators.md) and local property declarations.

### Language

To declare an action that executes a sequence of other actions, use the [**{...}** operator](Operator_..._.md).
