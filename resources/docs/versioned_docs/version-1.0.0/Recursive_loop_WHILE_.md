title: 'Recursive loop (WHILE)'
---

The *recursive loop operator* is similar to a regular [loop](Loop_FOR_.md) operator, with the only difference being that iteration is performed recursively until at a certain point the set of objects collections satisfying the condition becomes empty. As a result, there is no sense in defining *alternative* actions with this operator.

### Language

The syntax of the recursive loop operator is described by the [**WHILE** operator](WHILE_operator.md).

### Examples

import {CodeSample} from './CodeSample.mdx'
